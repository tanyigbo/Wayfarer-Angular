### User Stories
####  📌 Sprint 1: Landing Page

As a user, I want to be able to navigate to the website's landing page ("/") and see a basic splash page displaying the name of the website.

As a user, I expect to see a site-wide header on every page with a link to the home page and a list of cities.

#### 📌 Sprint 2: HomePage

As a user, I want to view the "San Francisco" page ("/cities/1") which includes the site-wide header, the city name, and an iconic photo of the city.

As a user, I want to see a list of posts on the San Francisco page, sorted by newest first, with the post titles linked to individual post "show" pages.

As a user, I need the ability to use the search bar to search through the titles and content of the posts.

As a user, I should be able to click on the title of a post and be redirected to a "show" page to view the details of that post.

#### 📌 Sprint 3: Validations

As a user, I should be able to view city pages for "London" and "Gibraltar".

As a user, I expect the post title to have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum length of 200 characters.

As a user, I want to ensure that a post's content cannot be empty.

#### 📌 Sprint 4: Weather API

As a user, I want the website to call the Open Weather API for each city to display the current weather on each city's page.
